    <p>Paraguay, located in the heart of South America, is often referred to as the "Corazón de América" (Heart of America). Known for its rich Guaraní heritage, vibrant culture, and lush natural landscapes, Paraguay is home to breathtaking attractions like the Iguazu Falls, the Gran Chaco, and the Paraguay River. The country is famous for its traditional music, handcrafted ñandutí lace, and delicious dishes like sopa paraguaya and chipa.
