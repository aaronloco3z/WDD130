      <p>My name is Aaron, and I’m excited to be part of this course. I enjoy collaborating with others and helping people, which I believe will be a strength as we work on group assignments. I’m committed to understanding the material, contributing meaningfully, and learning together with my team. My goal is to grow both academically and personally through this experience, and I look forward to the challenges and opportunities this course will bring.</p>
